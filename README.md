# Experiment 3: Python Data Analysis

Python script/code for the given problems: EXPERIMENT 3: PROBLEM 1, EXPERIMENT 3: PROBLEM 2.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting the problems, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:

- **Importing Libraries**: Essential for accessing functionalities provided by external libraries.
- **Data Input and Output**: Reading data into DataFrames and displaying data.
- **Indexing and Selection**: Accessing specific data points using integer-based (`iloc`) and label-based (`loc`) methods.
- **Boolean Indexing and Conditional Selection**: Filtering data based on conditions.
- **Column Subsetting**: Selecting specific columns from the DataFrame.
- **Logical Operations**: Combining multiple conditions to filter data.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**

   Download the dataset from the following link and save it to your default user folder:
   [Cars Dataset](http://bit.ly/Cars_file)

2. **Problem 1**

   - **Filename:** `Surname_Pandas-P1.py`
   - **Task:** 
     1. Load the `.csv` file into a DataFrame named `cars` using the `pandas` library.
     2. Display the first five and last five rows of the `cars` DataFrame.

3. **Problem 2**

   - **Filename:** `Surname_Pandas-P2.py`
   - **Task:** Using the `cars` DataFrame from Problem 1:
     1. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.).
     2. Display the row that contains the model 'Mazda RX4'.
     3. Determine the number of cylinders (`cyl`) for the car model 'Camaro Z28'.
     4. Find the number of cylinders (`cyl`) and gear type (`gear`) for the car models 'Mazda RX4 Wag', 'Ford Pantera L', and 'Honda Civic'.

4. **Submission**

   - Save your code in Jupyter Notebooks and submit them in the designated submission bin.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library

## Notes

- Ensure your code is well-commented and easy to understand.
- Verify that your scripts run without errors before submission.
